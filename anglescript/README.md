# Description
AngleScript is an lightweight online editor for html, css and javascript written in React, which allows you to test your codes in real time without hampering with your application. 

# Usage
AngleScript can be used to test you front-end codes and create small code snippets and later copy them into your actual work and get the same result. By testing your code before applying it to your actual projects can help you identify bugs in small codes and make changes to it without breaking your application.
It can also be used for coding interviews as it renders live results.
